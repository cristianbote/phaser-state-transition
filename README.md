State Transition Plugin for Phaser
=======================
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/phaser-state-transition.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/phaser-state-transition)

## About
Currently the switch between states is really static and a game should be able to transition between states. Therefore, this plugin does exactly that: draws the `game.world` into a `renderTexture` which is rendered on a `sprite`, and finally it's tweening that sprite.

## How to use it
You have several options here

### Straight
Just download the `dist/phaser-state-transition.min.js` file and you're done
 
### Npm

```bash
npm install phaser-state-transition --save
```

## Usage
Since we're talking about v2, there's been some changes. Now, the plugin basically overrides the create state method, so you could keep you're code the same, and just add transition configs where you see fit.

```js
const MenuState = {
    create: () => {
        let game = this;
        let playButton;
        
        // Let's assume when the user taps on the window, we wanna change the state
        this.game.input.onTap.addOnce(() => {
            game.state.start(
                'playState', // The play state
                Phaser.Plugin.StateTransition.In.SlideLeft,
                Phaser.Plugin.StateTransition.Out.SlideLeft
            );
        })
    }
};

const PlayState = {
    create: () => {
        let game = this;
        let playButton;
        
        // Let's assume when the user taps on the window, we wanna change the state
        this.game.input.onTap.addOnce(() => {
            game.state.start(
                'menuState', // The menu state
                Phaser.Plugin.StateTransition.In.SlideLeft,
                Phaser.Plugin.StateTransition.Out.SlideLeft
            );
        })
    }
};
```

Notice the 2 optional params, that are transition config instances. There are several available by default, you should run this: `console.log(Phaser.Plugin.StateTransition.Out);` and `console.log(Phaser.Plugin.StateTransition.In);`. Obviously you could easily add your own nice transition as well. For example:

```javascript
game.state.start(
 state, {
  ease: Phaser.Easing.Exponential.InOut,
   duration: 2500,
   intro: false,
   props: {
    alpha: 0
   }
  }, {
   ease: Phaser.Easing.Exponential.InOut,
   duration: 2500,
   intro: true,
   props: {
    alpha: 1
   }
  }
);
```

The parameters `intro`, `duration`, `props` and `ease` are mandatory.
- `intro` values should not be changed. 
- `props` can be either an object `{alpha: 1, ...}` or a function returning an object:

```javascript
function(game){
  return {alpha: 1, ...};
}
```
